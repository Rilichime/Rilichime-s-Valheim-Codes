# Cinderveil RPG Classes and Professions

A comprehensive class and profession system for Valheim that adds RPG-style character progression through Almanac custom status effects. Featuring 18 classes and 10 professions!

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Check your Almanac config options, or this mod won't work!

**Status Effects = On**  
**Max Effects = 2**

(You can set max effects to whatever number you want, but I recommend 2, so you can have 1 profession and 1 class. If you want to multi-class etc., set it higher, just be aware it might make your game too easy.)

## ⚖️ Balance Notes

- Classes provide combat-focused bonuses
- Professions offer utility and skill improvements for non-combat activities
- This mod is balanced around challenging gameplay and works best with difficulty mods
- The default recommendation of 2 max effects encourages focused builds (1 class + 1 profession) but you can set it to whatever you prefer! (If you want to be a Barbarian-Mage-Warrior-Assasin menace, I won't stop you!)
- As it currently stands, it is not possible to add negative modifiers to resistances with Almanac. So, class weaknesses to Fire, Poison, Blunt, Pierce, etc. will not work at present. Sorry about that! I hope this becomes possible in the future, for better balancing.

I fully expect there to be issues in the mods current state, as I have not had much time to test it yet. Classes  may not be balanced. Achivements may not have the right prefabs listed for certain items. Please let me know about any issues you find!
