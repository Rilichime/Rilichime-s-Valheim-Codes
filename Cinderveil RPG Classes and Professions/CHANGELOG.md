### Version 1.0.2
- Changed [Class] Paladin and [Class] Assasin level 1 requirements (While playing I didn't get GreylingElite or GreylingBeeKeeper spawns, so I removed requirements for those.)
- Bug fix for [Class] Conjurer buffs for levels 2, 3, & 4 (ID and name were wrong numbers)
- Changed [Pick] Surtling Core from x30 to x50 and fixed the name (said x100 which was wrong)
- Fixed [Pick] Dandelion x300 to correct name (was titled x100 despite requirements being x300)
- Changed [Class] Striker requirements for all levels (Previously, it just required total kills, which was not progression-gated very well, so I changed it to require killing any 2 biome enemies multiple times after level 2.)
